**This is not my software**.  Visual Math Editor is a tool written by David
Grima and can be downloaded from his own website here:

[http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/index.html](http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/index.html)

The reason I am redistributing this code is that the version available to
download via David's site is rather out of date (2.0.33) but the version he
himself is hosting is much later, 2.0.58, and it has some fixes which were
important to the users I was supporting at the time.

David did not respond to requests to make a later version directly
downloadable.

As can be seen here, the software is licenced for distribution under the GPL3
licence so I believe am I compliantly making this latest version available.

If you use this software via this git repository and have problems then
**PLEASE DO NOT COMPLAIN TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR**. Patches welcome.
